### A streamlit-based web app made by me will let us go through each and every layer of a model and will show us the output of each and every neuron to let us understand how it will highlight/extract features from an image.

### In this app I'm providing 2 options, say
>  ###  A Default model (Model uploaded by me.)
> 
> ### A Customized model (User can upload their own model and can visualize.)
### After that, The app can automatically detects the different layers in model and will give you the dropdown of layers.
### After you select your layer, The app will show you the outputs from all neurons in that layer.
